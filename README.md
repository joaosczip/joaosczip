- Currently working as a back-end developer for the world's biggest brewery. 

- I've started my adventure in this world in 2012 and have about 3 years in experience with software development and engineering. 

- Focused in web development and some software engineering techniques, one of my goals are to write the most flexible, abstracted and maintainable code. 

- Today my main stack is NodeJS and ReactJS with Typescript, also work with Docker, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps and AWS (Serverless, ECS, Lambda). I have a degree in Information Systems and some of my current focus are Clean Architecure, SOLID principles, TDD, automated tests, Microservices (Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes). 

- I also write some articles that you can see here https://dev.to/joaosczip and here https://medium.com/@joaogbsczip/
