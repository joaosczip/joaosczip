- Currently working as a system analyst. 

- I have about 2 years in experiencie with software develoment. 

- Focused in web development and some software engineer techniques, one of my goals are to write the most flexible, abstracted and maintainable code. 

- Today my main stack is NodeJS and ReactJS with Typescript, also work with Docker, GitLab CI and AWS (Serverless, ECS). I have a degree in Information Systems and actually some of my focus are Clean Architecure, SOLID principles, TDD, automated tests and CI/CD.
